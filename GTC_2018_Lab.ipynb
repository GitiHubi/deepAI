    "The objective of this lab is to walk you through a deep learning based methodology that can be used to detect of global and local anomalies in financial datasets. The proposed method is based on the following assumptions: \n",
    "\n",
    ">1. the majority of financial transactions recorded within an organizations’ ERP-system relate to regular day-to-day business activities and perpetrators need to deviate from the ”regular” in order to conduct fraud,\n",
    ">2. such deviating behaviour will be recorded by a very limited number of financial transactions and their respective attribute values or combination of attribute values and we refer to such deviations as \"anomalies\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Concluding from these assumptions we can learn a model of regular journal entries with minimal ”harm” caused by the potential anomalous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to detect such anomalies, we will train deep autoencoder networks to learn a compressed but \"lossy\" model of regular transactions and their underlying posting pattern. Imposing a strong regularization onto the networks hidden layers limits the networks' ability to memorize the characteristics of anomalous journal entries. Once the training process is completed, the network will be able to reconstruct regular journal entries, while failing to do so for the anomalous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the lab you should be familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. the basic concepts, intuitions and major building blocks of autoencoder neural networks,\n",
    ">2. the techniques of pre-processing financial data in order to learn a model of its characteristics,\n",
    ">3. the application of autoencoder neural networks to detect anomalies in large-scale financial data, and,\n",
    ">4. the interpretation of the detection results of the networks as well as its reconstruction loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, that this lab is not a complete nor comprehensive forensic data analysis approach or fraud examination strategy. However, the methodology and code provided in this lab can be repurposed or adopted to detect anomalous records in a variety of financial datasets. Subsequently, the detected records might serve as a starting point for a more detailed and substantive examination by auditors or compliance personnel. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, we assume that you are familiar with the general concepts of deep neural networks (DNN) and GPUs as well as PyTorch and Python. For more information on these concepts please check the relevant labs of NVIDIA's Deep Learning Institute (DLI). "
