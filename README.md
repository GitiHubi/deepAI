![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)

An interactive lab we prepared for NVIDIA's GPU Technology Conference 2018 that will walk you through the detection of accounting anomalies using deep autoencoder neural networks. The the lab content is based on Python, IPython Notebook, and PyTorch.

The recording of our talk is available via NVIDIA's GTC On-Demand under the following [external link](https://on-demand-gtc.gputechconf.com/gtcnew/sessionview.php?sessionName=s8343-detection+of+financial+statement+fraud+using+deep+autoencoder+networks).
